# Vulnerability scanning and assessment


## Objective

The Network Vulnerability Assessment project aimed to assess the security of your home network infrastructure remotely. The primary objective is to identify potential vulnerabilities and security weaknesses within your home network, including connected devices and network configurations. This project will enable you to enhance your cybersecurity skills and take proactive measures to secure your home network environment.

### Skills Learned

- Proficiency in conducting remote vulnerability assessments.
- Understanding of common home network vulnerabilities and attack vectors.
- Ability to analyze network configurations and device settings for security weaknesses.
- Experience in recommending and implementing security best practices for home network protection.
- Development of proactive security assessment methodologies for maintaining a secure home network.
- 
### Tools Used

- Network scanning tools such as Nmap or Fing for discovering and enumerating devices connected to your home network.
- Vulnerability scanners like Nessus Home or OpenVAS for identifying known vulnerabilities in network devices.
- Router administration interface for reviewing and updating network configurations and settings.
- Online resources and forums for researching common home network vulnerabilities and security best practices.


## Steps:
## Inventory and Mapping
- Identify all devices connected to your home network, including computers, smartphones, tablets, smart TVs, gaming consoles, and IoT devices.
- Create a network map detailing the IP addresses, MAC addresses, and device types for each connected device.

## Network Scanning
- Conduct a network scan using Nmap or Fing to identify active hosts and open ports on your home network.
- Enumerate network services running on each device to identify potential attack vectors.

## Vulnerability Assessment
- Perform a vulnerability scan using Nessus Home or OpenVAS to identify known vulnerabilities in network devices and services.
- Analyze scan results to prioritize vulnerabilities based on severity and potential impact on your home network security.

## Router Configuration Review
- Log in to your router administration interface and review router configurations and settings for security weaknesses.
- Ensure that the router firmware is up-to-date and that default credentials have been changed to strong, unique passwords.

## Device Security Check
- Review security settings and configurations for individual devices connected to your home network.
- Update device firmware and software to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
- Enable encryption protocols such as WPA2 or WPA3 for Wi-Fi networks and disable outdated protocols like WEP.

## Mitigation and Remediation
- Implement security recommendations and best practices based on the findings of the vulnerability assessment.
- Apply patches and updates to vulnerable devices and services to mitigate known vulnerabilities.
- Configure network segmentation and access controls to restrict unauthorized access to sensitive network resources.

## Documentation and Follow-Up
- Document findings from the vulnerability assessment, including identified vulnerabilities, remediation measures, and security improvements implemented.
- Establish a schedule for regular vulnerability assessments and security audits to maintain a secure home network environment.
- Stay informed about emerging threats and security advisories affecting home network devices and services, and take proactive measures to address them.
